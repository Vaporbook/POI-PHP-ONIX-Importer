               however, ONIX updating is invariably by complete record replacement using code 03, and code 04 is not used.

            <td>Use when sending an instruction to delete a record which was previously issued. Note that a delete instruction should NOT
               be used when a product is cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be handled as a change
               of availability status, leaving the receiver to decide whether to retain or delete the record. A delete instruction is only
               used when there is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued in error.
